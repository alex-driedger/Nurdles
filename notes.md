Pattern Notes
=============
Notes for the Apps Factory Pattern project

## MAIN README
### Git Workflow
- [ ] Last bullet point -> frequent commits. Should be pushes into remote every to days at *least*?

### Deployment
- [ ] caf-projectName has a dead link

### Training
- [ ] Direct co-ops toward training/ folder with a link

### Nice to haves
- [ ] Links to technologies website (note: I needed to lookup BEM Architecture)

## TRAINING README
### Assumptions
- [ ] "Assumptions: I'm a big fan of letting every developer *use* the tools **he** or she prefers." ;-)
- [ ] iTerm2 should be listed as an assumption (some may have considered defaulting to Terminal.app, not that it really makes a huge difference)

### Begin
- [ ] `pattern.sublime-project` opens the folder `/Users/robdrimmie/Factory/Pattern`
