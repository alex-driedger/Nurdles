Here's the challenge with web-based applications: There's a lot of different systems in play. 

The basic principles are all fundamental concepts that have been part of computing for decades but aren't often exposed to users, so understanding how they all interact requires loading in a huge amount of information. It's my intent to relay that information in the context of a sample application, I feel it helps with the understanding and takes away some of the pain of digging up all the steps through Google and Stack Overflow. 

Or at least helps identify some helpful keywords while searching.

As much as possible I'm going to leave implementation up to you. I'm going to tell you what to do then leave it to you to discover how to do it, but getting up and running at setting the stage does require that I be explicit - painfully so at times - in the commands that need to be executed and the content of files. 

Assumptions:
I'm a big fan of letting every developer using the tools she prefers. For the sake of this document though, there are some assumptions I'm going to make.

* you are using a stock OS X system, as prepped by me for working at the Apps Factory and configured by you following the welcome.md file
* you are using Sublime Text 2 for your editor
* you have cloned this repository to `~/Factory/Pattern` already, and are accessing the content from your local system

Begin:

Launch iTerm2, type `cd ~/F[tab]/P[tab]`. By default, OS X uses BASH and has it configured for autocompletion, which is triggered with the tab key and super helpful. Type `open pat[tab]p[tab]`, this should be filled in as `open pattern.sublime-project`. This should open Sublime with the Sidebar open to the "Pattern" folder. It will automatically open the `pattern.sublime-project` file, which you can close using Command-W.

The project structure in the sidebar is the most obvious thing at this point, and without getting into it too deeply yet, here's what's stored where:

* api: scripts that manage interactions with the server application go here
* bin: scripts related to application execution
* build: output from the Continuous Integration process
* client: scripts for various client applications
* db: scripts for configuring, initializing and interacting with the database
* node_modules: third party libraries, typically managed by node install
* spec: tests for this application
* test: tests for third party libraries and, somewhat confusingly, this application.
* training: this document and associated resources

Each folder contains additional `README.md` files, which provide a bit more information. If there's information you feel is important and worth sharing, please edit the files directly and issue a pull request. This is a fundamental Apps Factory trait: **make the change you want to see**. It may change before being fully incorporated, but if you identify something as wrong, help us make it right. Please!

One thing you may note about the application is that there's a bunch of server stuff right in the root and a separate area for the client stuff. It may make more sense to have a `server` folder much in the same way there is a `client` folder. And you'd be right! But because we host our applications on Heroku, all server logic must be in the project root. So it's a little messier than I'd prefer, but with reasonable justification.

This could be mitigated with several git repositories, one for the server and one for each of the clients but for the purposes of the Pattern I'm keeping it all together. When we begin a new project for an Apps Factory client, we may eventually break their repo into several, but all-in-one is the default.

Click on the grey arrow beside `bin` to expand the node, then click on `start`. Note that the file is displayed but a new tab is not created at the top of the document pane in Sublime. Now double-click it. This is moderately strange (but ultimately logical and useful) behaviour for an editor, and can be confusing in the early days.

`start` is the entry point into the application. Essentially (which means I'm glossing over detail), all it does is load `app.js` in the root. The files exists primarily to create consistency across development and production environments, as `bin/Procfile` is required by Heroku and does effectively the same thing.

It's a good starting point. It creates an anonymous instance of the class described by `app.js` and calls the `run` function, passing in an environment variable that identifies the port on which it will listen to requests. Open `app.js` in Sublime.

Without getting too deep into it, `app.js` contains one function: `run`. The function configures ExpressJS, initializes the database and loads in the api routes. The last few lines of the file, the assignment of `module.exports` is a RequireJS feature that exposes functions to anything using this file. It's reasonable for now to think of this as defining public functions. Everything within `app.js` is inaccessible outside the class it describes, unless explicitly exported.

After setting everything up, the `run` function calls `app.listen(port)`, which passes control to ExpressJS. As new requests come into the server, ExpressJS examines the request to figure out how to handle it. This process allows me to divert a little bit and talk about HTTP.

HTTP is the protocol that describes how data is transferred through the World Wide Web. HTTP is a relatively simple Request and Response protocol. A User Agent sends a Request to the server, the server sends a Response. This simple format led to the still typical web application workflow of full page loads for every action the user takes.

AJAX formalized a process around that, which led to more interactive web applications, dubbed Web 2.0. AJAX still follows this same format, but the browser issues the Request outside the standard workflow, and updates the currently displayed page based on the content of the Response.

Before I can pop out of this tangent I need to go slightly sideways one more time to talk about URLs, then I can finish up with HTTP (for now) and get back to the application. Uniform Resource Locators are a subset of Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs). All URIs identify a resource (perhaps a user). URLs identify where to access that resource, such as http://example.com/user/1. That is a specific user's location and how one interacts with them.

Back up to HTTP for a bit. HTTP Requests have several properties, the one I want to talk about now is the verb. There are many verbs, most are not frequently used. The two most frequently used are GET and POST. From a technical standpoint the differences are unimportant at this time (they will be, don't you worry!) but it is the conceptual differences I want to discuss. 

GET Requests retrieve information *from* a server. So if a User Agent issues a GET request to http://example.com/user/1, the User Agent is asking the server to provide information about that resource - in this example, probably user profile information like user name, picture, etc. 

POST Requests send information *to* a server. If a User Agent issues a POST request to http://example.com/user/1, the User Agent is sending details about that resource to the server. Probably the same profile information but instead of asking the server for what it knows it is providing it to the server.

The other two commonly (though much less so than GET and POST) HTTP verbs used by web applications are PUT and DELETE. These don't matter unless you're trying to be RESTful, which we are. Except I don't really want to get into it right now, just know that being RESTful means that PUT requests are used for updating data, whereas POST requests are used for creating data. I'm pretty sure you can guess what DELETE is used for. This convention is important, and understanding RESTful APIs is awesome and you should totally do so, just not right now. 

And now we return to our regularly-scheduled application exploration.

Well, maybe not exactly. The classic model for web servers is to have a specific file that handles every URL. So if I go to http://example.com/login.php, there is a corresponding file on my server somewhere named login.php. Apache, or whatever web server software I'm using, loads that file and processing starts at line 1. This model is called the Page Controller Pattern. It has largely been superseeded by the Front Controller Pattern.

(The use of "Pattern" in the above names identifies them as Design Patterns, which is a helpful software develoment concept that I'm just going to avoid getting into outside this parenthetical ramble, because I've already thrown about a half-dozen different concepts at you already.)

The Front Controller Pattern dictates that all processing for a web application has a single entry point. Cosmetic benefits of this allow us to disassociate the web application itself from the file structure, so we get less ugly URLs like http://example.com/login or http://example.com/user/1 instead of exposing the architecture of the system to users through more traditional URLs that may use of a QueryString (which I'm also not getting into) such as http://example.com/user.php?id=1.

There are architectural benefits as well, but I'm of the opnion that the pretty URLs are how it took hold. 

Routes (finally, back to the application!) are how we associate these pretty URLs with the functionality we're coding. 

Since the server application is a pure API, the routes are contained in the `api/routes.js` file. This file's primary function `bindRoutes` connects the functionality defined by the other files (mostly, there's a couple of anonymous callbacks with short functionality explicitly bound) in the `api` directory (by default, `user.js` and `statemanager.js`) and binds it to specific URLs and HTTP methods using ExpressJS' routing system.

In many ways, this is the point in the application where we start adding real functionality to it. All the previous stuff was setup and configuration. Now we can make the application actually do something.

Out of the box the application has a concept of user accounts and very simple access control, but that's about it.
