Here's the challenge with web-based applications: There's a lot of different systems in play. 

The basic principles are all fundamental concepts that have been part of computing for decades but aren't often exposed to users, so understanding how they all interact requires loading in a huge amount of information. It's my intent to relay that information in the context of a sample application, I feel it helps with the understanding and takes away some of the pain of digging up all the steps through Google and Stack Overflow. 

As much as possible I'm going to leave implementation up to you. I'm going to tell you what to do then leave it to you to discover how to do it, but getting up and running at setting the stage does require that I be explicit - painfully so at times - in the commands that need to be executed and the content of files. 

Assumptions:
I'm a big fan of letting every developer using the tools she prefers. For the sake of this document though, there are some assumptions I'm going to make.

* you are using a stock OS X system, as prepped by me for working at the Apps Factory and configured by you following the welcome.md file
* you are using Sublime Text 2 for your editor
* you have cloned this repository and are accessing the content from your local system
